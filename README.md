# Favourites for Spotify

## Getting Started

A web application to display a user's Spotify listening statistics. My desire for a web app that showed me my Spotify listening statistics in an intuitive and informative way inspired me to create this project.

This was one of my first "full stack" projects...

I started this project in October 2022 by learning how REST APIs work and interacting with the Spotify API. I then wrote the Python code which implemented Authorization Code Flow. During the middle of December I began designing the UI and its functionality. I then implemented this throughout the rest of December and January. Since then, I have been refactoring code...
